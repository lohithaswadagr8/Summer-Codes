# Summer-Codes
This a set of codes that I performed during the summer of 2025.
It has several different self initiated projects (mostly involving python as of now).

## New! Response Function Calculation
This project involves me trying to find the Spin-Spin response function of a Weyl Semimetal using Mathematica. Part of my project under Prof.Sayandip Ghosh.

## Population Modelling
This project involves a set of population models. It uses prey-predator and competition equations to model population along with some variations like season-dependence of birth rates, discrete and continuos variants etc.

## Heat on a Ring 
This is not a big project, rather a single Jupyter Notebook file which simulate how heat flows on a ring with initial heat conditions.
This uses fourier series method to speedup computation.
I plan on soon doing it using mathematica as well.

## Kicked Rotor Modelling
This is a project done in order to improve my understanding on the kicked rotor model that is famously used in quantum chaos research.
It involves various programs each giving out different types of outputs like phase-space diagrams, kick number vs average momentum graph etc.
